# Multithread-Base
Multithread base for beginners who are starting to code in C++ and are
willing to learn the basics about threads and how threads work with your
workloads

# What's included?
Simple as it can be, default console app template from Visual Studio.
Difference is that now everything you run runs on separate threads and is
appropriately split on your_amount_of_cpu_cores number of threads.

# But, this isn't complete and there are things missing to this base?
This was made for a school-like lessons. It's just a stripped base for basic 
threading operations and isn't made for any complex threading sorting of workloads
etc. If you have time, you can modify it to your liking.
